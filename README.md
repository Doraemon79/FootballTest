#browse to a folder and give a name to the file of output
#the column you choose to be sortable will have a small arrow next to the title to sort them
#You can choose to enter the tricode (ex: BOU,ARS), it is my last introduction and it is not much tested yet, the tricodes must be precise with a "," as separation, some  tricodes like BRO and ASV have an ID in the XML which is not associated to the other values so they will not be rapresented. Once the tricodes are entered, the matching teams will be represented as usual, with the limit of number of teams represented (if you ask for 3 teams but the limit is set to 2 just the first 2 will be represented) ,
#If the tricode box is left empty it will not be considered
#In the way the code is made it is very easy to add rules, I limited myself to not braf around but if you want any more just tell me.
#The code works fine if there are any issues please let me know.
